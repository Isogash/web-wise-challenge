Love Your Mountain
==================

This website is made with Bootstrap, jQuery and Less. The src/less/main.less file is compiled into css/main.css and contains all of the stylesheets for Bootstrap and for index.html.

The website is responsive to viewport breakpoints so it can be viewed easily on most devices.

The top of the website is also animated to scroll with a parallax background using jQuery for more visual impact. This animation is disabled on phones and tablets where it is more likely to stutter and hinder the user.

The Less file is laid out in a way that reflects the html document. They are tightly coupled in heirarchy, which makes development on the static page easier, but is less flexible for templating purposes. The idea here is that prototyping and development, possibly working with a dedicated designer, will be faster and easier to maintain. Further refactoring with variable names could still be done.

There is a git repository on https://github.com/Isogash/web-wise-challenge

Thanks very much for this oppurtunity, and I hope you consider me for the next stage of the application, I am looking forward to meeting you!
